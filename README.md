## üî• Basic Firewall Management and Network Traffic Filtering

This project demonstrates foundational firewall management skills and an understanding of network traffic filtering using Windows Firewall. Instead of blocking a specific port (as originally intended), this walkthrough blocks a **specific program (Google Chrome)** using **inbound and outbound rules**, showcasing similar concepts of traffic control.

---

## üß∞ Tasks Covered

1. Open the firewall configuration tool (Windows Firewall).
2. List current firewall rules.
3. Create a rule to **block inbound and outbound traffic** for a specific application (Google Chrome).
4. Test the rule by attempting to access the internet using the blocked application.
5. Remove the rule to restore original functionality.
6. Document GUI steps used in the process.
7. Summarize how firewalls filter network traffic.

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps Performed

### 1. Open Firewall Configuration Tool
- Open **Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security** via Start Menu or Control Panel.

### 2. List Current Firewall Rules
- Navigate to **Inbound Rules** and **Outbound Rules** to view existing entries.

### 3. Block Inbound & Outbound Traffic for Chrome
- Go to **Inbound Rules > New Rule**.
- Select **Program**, then browse and select `chrome.exe`.

<img width="1214" alt="6" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28e1bde9-25cc-4865-86fa-9c2ab26e7e9d" />
- Apply the rule to **Domain, Private, and Public** profiles.
- Name the rule (e.g., `ChromeIn`).

- Repeat the process in **Outbound Rules** to block outgoing connections.

### 4. Test the Rule
- Open Google Chrome and try accessing a website.
- The connection should fail due to the rule blocking network traffic.

#### üö´ Blocking a Specific Port (Example with Port 25 - Telnet)
*Same steps as above, but select "Port" instead of "Program" in the rule creation process.*
![Block Port 25]

## üß† Firewall Traffic Filtering Summary

Firewalls act as a barrier between your computer and potential threats from the internet. They use **rules** to determine whether to **allow or block** incoming and outgoing traffic based on:

- **Program path**
- **Port number**
- **Protocol (TCP/UDP)**
- **IP addresses**
- **Network profiles (Domain, Private, Public)**

By managing these rules, users can control network access at a granular level, improving system security and monitoring.
